# NestJS-The-Complete-Developers-Guide

This repo covers NestJS The Complete Developers Guide course contents and also several projects that I implemented during this entire span

The deployed version of Backend Project Car Value Estimate can be found [here](https://car-value-estimate-service-production.up.railway.app/)

I have also added postman collection which contains all endpoints and the request formats for them. Please change localhost to https://car-value-estimate-service-production.up.railway.app/ if you want to test the endpoints on heroku.

**_NOTE:_**  The application was previously deployed to Heroku but due to the Free Tier shutting down it was moved to Railway. Due to Railway App restrictions the deployed application will only be available for the first 20-21 days of the month.
