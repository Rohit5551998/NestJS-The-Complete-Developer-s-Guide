# NestJS-The-Complete-Developers-Guide

This repo covers NestJS The Complete Developers Guide course contents and also several projects that I implemented during this entire span

The deployed version of Backend Project Car Value Estimate can be found [here](https://car-value-estimate-service-production.up.railway.app/)

I have also added postman collection which contains all endpoints and the request formats for them. Please change localhost to https://car-value-estimate-service-production.up.railway.app/ if you want to test the endpoints on heroku.
