# NestJS-The-Complete-Developers-Guide

This repo covers NestJS The Complete Developers Guide course contents and also several projects that I implemented during this entire span

The deployed version of Backend Project Car Value Estimate can be found [here](https://morning-gorge-37987.herokuapp.com/)

I have also added postman collection which contains all endpoints and the request formats for them. Please change localhost to https://morning-gorge-37987.herokuapp.com/ if you want to test the endpoints on heroku.
